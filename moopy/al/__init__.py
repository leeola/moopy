'''al stands for Abstraction Layer. The AL takes common and usually simple
tasks in modo, such as created a vertex, or querying the number of verts in
a mesh, and wraps them in simple module level functions.

The goal of this is to keep all modo specific calls within this package,
so that any changes within modo need to only be updated in this package.
