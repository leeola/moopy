WARNING:
    Moopy is still in the early development and experimental stage and is
    not recommended for use.

INSTALLATION:
    Installing Moopy is pretty simple. Simply download Moopy, and unzip it
    into the following OS specific directories:
    
    - OSX: ~/Library/Application\ Support/Luxology/Scripts
    - Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\YourUserName\Application Data\Luxology\Scripts
    
EXAMPLES:
    All the files in the ./examples folder are ment to be run directly by modo.
    These are designed to show you examples of how to use Moopy. Run it,
    see what it does, and examine the code.

DOCUMENTATION:
    Documentation will be slightly handled by the examples. There will be API
    docs generated from Epydocs, but any further documentation outside of
    examples and api docs will be done by the community and is not planned at
    this time.
